# Implementation Plan - Streamlined Telemetry Processor

**Started:** 2024-12-28  
**Source:** D:\Source\pubg-tracker-bot\STREAMLINED_TELEMETRY_PROCESSOR_PLAN.md  
**Complexity:** Medium (2-3 hours estimated)

## Source Analysis

- **Source Type**: Local implementation plan document
- **Core Features**: Advanced telemetry processing with weapon analytics, kill chains, assists calculation
- **Dependencies**: Leverages existing @j03fr0st/pubg-ts types, no additional dependencies needed
- **Architecture Pattern**: Service-oriented with clean separation between processing and presentation

## Target Integration

- **Integration Points**: 
  - New `TelemetryProcessorService` in `src/services/`
  - Enhanced `DiscordBotService` with analytics formatting
  - New analytics types in `src/types/analytics-results.types.ts`
- **Affected Files**:
  - `src/types/analytics-results.types.ts` (create)
  - `src/services/telemetry-processor.service.ts` (create) 
  - `src/services/discord-bot.service.ts` (update)
  - Tests for new functionality
- **Pattern Matching**: Follow existing service patterns, use established logger and error handling

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Core Types and Interfaces
- [ ] Create `src/types/analytics-results.types.ts` with minimal result interfaces
- [ ] Define WeaponStats, KillChain, AssistInfo, PlayerAnalysis, MatchAnalysis interfaces

### Phase 2: TelemetryProcessor Service  
- [ ] Create `src/services/telemetry-processor.service.ts`
- [ ] Implement main `processMatchTelemetry` method using existing telemetry types
- [ ] Add individual player analysis with filtering by player name
- [ ] Implement weapon statistics calculation from multiple telemetry event types
- [ ] Add kill chain analysis with configurable time windows
- [ ] Implement assist calculation algorithm using damage and knockdown correlation
- [ ] Add weapon name resolution using existing DAMAGE_CAUSER_NAME dictionary

### Phase 3: Discord Bot Integration
- [ ] Update `src/services/discord-bot.service.ts` with TelemetryProcessor integration  
- [ ] Add TelemetryProcessor to constructor and dependency injection
- [ ] Update `createMatchSummaryEmbeds` to use processor when telemetry is available
- [ ] Add enhanced player embed creation with analytics
- [ ] Implement enhanced stats formatting methods for combat, weapons, chains, assists
- [ ] Add enhanced timeline formatting using raw telemetry events
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with basic embeds when telemetry fails

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Create unit tests for TelemetryProcessorService  
- [ ] Add integration tests for Discord bot enhanced functionality
- [ ] Test with real telemetry data to validate calculations
- [ ] Verify error handling and fallback scenarios
- [ ] Validate performance with large telemetry datasets

### Phase 5: Documentation and Polish
- [ ] Add JSDoc documentation to new methods
- [ ] Update any configuration if needed
- [ ] Verify linting and formatting standards
- [ ] Ensure proper error logging and debugging

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] All telemetry processor features implemented correctly
- [ ] Discord integration working with enhanced analytics
- [ ] Tests written and passing for new functionality  
- [ ] No regressions in existing bot functionality
- [ ] Performance acceptable for typical match sizes
- [ ] Error handling robust for missing/invalid telemetry
- [ ] Code follows project patterns and standards

## Risk Mitigation

- **Potential Issues**: 
  - Large telemetry datasets causing performance issues
  - Missing telemetry events in some matches
  - Type compatibility issues with @j03fr0st/pubg-ts updates
- **Rollback Strategy**: 
  - Maintain backward compatibility with basic embeds
  - Use try-catch blocks for telemetry processing
  - Git checkpoints after each major phase

## Current Status: Ready to Begin

**Next Steps**: Start with Phase 1 - Create analytics result types
