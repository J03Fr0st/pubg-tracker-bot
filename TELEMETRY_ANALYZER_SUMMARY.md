- Processes multiple event types (kills, damage, positions, zones)

#### 2. Advanced Analysis Algorithms
- **Weapon Effectiveness**: Kill/shot ratios, optimal range analysis
- **Zone Timing**: Rotation analysis with phase-specific recommendations
- **Team Coordination**: Revive success rates, spacing analysis
- **Third-Party Detection**: Multi-team encounter identification

#### 3. Smart Mistake Detection
- **High-Impact Errors**: Prioritized by game impact
- **Player-Specific Issues**: Individual accountability
- **Pattern Recognition**: Repeated mistake identification

#### 4. Strategic Recommendations
- **Priority-Based**: Ranked by importance and impact

## 📱 Automatic Analysis Integration

### How It Works
The telemetry analyzer is integrated into the match monitoring system and runs automatically when new matches are detected for monitored players.

1. **Add Players**: Use `/add playername:YourPlayerName` to start monitoring
2. **Automatic Analysis**: System detects new matches and runs analysis automatically
3. **Discord Results**: Detailed analysis embeds are sent to Discord automatically

### Response Structure
1. **Overview Embed**: Performance scores and rankings
2. **Critical Mistakes**: High-impact errors with fixes
3. **Strategic Recommendations**: Priority-based advice
4. **Engagement Analysis**: Combat effectiveness breakdown
5. **Positioning Analysis**: Zone and rotation performance
6. **Team Coordination**: Teamwork and communication analysis
7. **Coaching Tips**: Personalized improvement plans

## 🎮 Analysis Capabilities

### What It Can Detect
- ✅ Positioning patterns and zone management
- ✅ Engagement outcomes and weapon effectiveness
- ✅ Team coordination indicators
- ✅ Timing and decision patterns
- ✅ Third-party vulnerability
- ✅ Resource management efficiency

### Performance Scoring (0-100)
- **90-100**: Excellent performance
- **80-89**: Good with minor issues
- **70-79**: Average with improvement areas
- **60-69**: Below average, needs attention
- **<60**: Poor performance, significant work needed

## 🔍 Analysis Examples

### Critical Mistake Detection
```typescript
{
  type: 'ZONE_MANAGEMENT',
  player: 'PlayerName',
  description: 'Team took 150 damage from blue zone',
  impact: 'HIGH',
  recommendation: 'Start rotating at 60% zone timer remaining'
}
```

### Coaching Tip Generation
```typescript
{
  category: 'IMMEDIATE',
  priority: 'HIGH',
  title: 'Master Zone Rotation Timing',
  actionSteps: [
    'Start rotating when zone timer shows 60% remaining',
    'Always secure a vehicle early game',
    'Memorize vehicle spawn locations'
  ],
  expectedTimeframe: '1-2 games',
  difficulty: 'EASY'
}
